# PM566-Final_Project

This is my PM566 final Project, and the tile of the project is: 
The role of Age, Pathologic Stage, and Vital Status for Female Patients when Developing Breast Cancer

Here is my website: https://kimmdd.github.io/PM566-Final_Project/

Breast cancer becomes the second leading cause of cancer death in women, so it is necessary for us to analyze the data of breast cancer patients and to discover the pathway and mechanism of breast cancer-related genes due to the high prevalence and mortality rate. Since breast cancer occurs common in women but rare in men, so in this project I focus on the female patients. Among the factors in the clinic data, I choose age, pathologic stage, and vital status as factors to examine how will they affect the female patients' outcome when they develop breast cancer.

The data I used is from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program). It is a cancer genomics program that collects over 20,000 cancer tissue samples and matches them with normal samples spanning over 33 cancer types (National Institute of Health).

I did two analysis: statistical analysis to examine the structure of clinic data at "age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis", "ajcc_pathologic_stage", and "vital_status" columns. Also, I did survival analysis to see the survival probability between young and old female patients when they develop breast cancer at each different pathologic stage.
